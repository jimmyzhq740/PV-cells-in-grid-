# Photovoltaic Cells in grid systems
The project focuses on addressing the power distribution challenge within a grid comprising three key elements: emulated photovoltaic(PV) panels, beacons (1W LEDs encased in ping pong balls), and a supercapacitor. Given the variable nature of PV systems, it is imperative to constantly manage the supply and demand of power for the LEDs.

# Project Objectives:
* To provide sufficient power to the LEDs from emulated PV panels. This ensures op- timal visibility of the lights by the robot’s camera.
* To maintain LEDs’ performance under all conditions. This includes the conditions where the excessive power can be stored in the capacitor, and conversely, when the PV panels fail to provide sufficient power, the stored energy can be utilized to supply the LEDs.
